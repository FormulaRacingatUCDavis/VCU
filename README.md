# Vehicle Control Unit

This is the *prototype* code for the vehicle control unit. It hosts the finite state machine (FSM) to control the state of the vehicle.

Completed
- Breadboard + microcontroller design

In-progress
- Finite state machine
  - Get precharging state from motor controller
  - Send torque requests to motor controller
  - and more...
